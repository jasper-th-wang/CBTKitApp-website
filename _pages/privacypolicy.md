**Last updated:** January 2, 2026

ReframeKit is a free cognitive behavioral therapy companion app developed by Jasper Wang. This privacy policy explains how the app handles your information.

## Information Collection and Use

ReframeKit is designed with privacy as a core principle. **We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.** All your thought entries, emotions, reframes, and drafts are stored locally on your device only in a secure SQLite database. Nothing is uploaded to external servers or shared with third parties.

## Data Storage

- **Local Storage Only**: All data remains exclusively on your device
- **Draft Persistence**: In-progress thought entries are automatically saved to your device using SQLite and temporary JSON files
- **No Cloud Sync**: Currently, ReframeKit does not sync your data to any cloud service (this may change in future versions with your explicit consent)
- **Data Deletion**: If you delete the app, all your data is permanently removed from your device

## TestFlight Beta Testing

ReframeKit is currently available exclusively through Apple's TestFlight beta testing program. During beta testing:

- **Apple Collection**: Apple collects crash logs, usage information, and any feedback you submit through TestFlight
- **Developer Access**: The developer receives crash reports (only if you choose to share them), your name, email address, and any feedback you provide through TestFlight
- **Crash Reports**: When the app crashes, you'll be asked if you want to share crash details with the developer - this is optional
- **Usage Restrictions**: Information shared through TestFlight is used solely to improve ReframeKit and is not shared with any third parties
- **Apple's Use**: Apple may use TestFlight data to improve the TestFlight app and detect fraud

## Third-Party Services

ReframeKit uses minimal third-party open-source libraries for core functionality (SwiftNavigation, Dependencies, Shared by Point-Free). These libraries operate entirely on your device and do not collect or transmit any data.

## No Analytics or Tracking

The app does not use any analytics tools, tracking SDKs, advertising networks, or cookies.

## Future Features

We are considering adding the following features in future versions:

- **Cloud Backup**: Optional cloud sync to preserve your data across devices (will require explicit opt-in)
- **Data Export**: Ability to export your thought history for backup purposes
- **Email Support**: Option to contact support via email from within the app

If any of these features are implemented, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly, and you will be notified of the changes.

## GDPR and Privacy Compliance

As ReframeKit does not collect or process any personal data (beyond what TestFlight collects during beta testing), the app inherently complies with GDPR, PIPEDA (Canada), and other data protection regulations.

## Children's Privacy

ReframeKit does not knowingly collect information from children. However, there is no minimum age requirement to use the app during beta testing. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used TestFlight to test this app, please contact us.

## Liability and Data Backup

While we strive to create a reliable app, we cannot guarantee it will be completely bug-free, especially during beta testing. Once the export feature is available, we recommend backing up your important thought entries regularly.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Significant changes will be communicated through TestFlight or the App Store.

## Jurisdiction

This privacy policy is governed by the laws of Canada.
