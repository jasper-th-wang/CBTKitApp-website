### `Latest`
# **Beta Release**
ReframeKit is a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) companion app designed to help you identify, challenge, and reframe negative thought patterns. Through a guided thought entry process, ReframeKit walks you through analyzing situations that trigger difficult emotions, identifying the thoughts behind them, and developing healthier perspectives.

#### Key Features
- **Guided Thought Entry Flow**: Step-by-step process to capture situations, thoughts, emotions, and reframes
- **Draft Persistence**: Your in-progress entries are automatically saved, so you can return to them anytime without losing your work
- **Thought History**: Review and learn from your past entries
- **Simple, Focused Interface**: Clean design that keeps you focused on the reflection process

#### What We're Testing
- Draft persistence reliability across app launches
- Overall flow and usability of the guided entry process

- UI responsiveness and keyboard interactions
- Desired features by the users

#### Known Areas Under Development
